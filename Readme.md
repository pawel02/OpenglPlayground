# Experimental OpenGL project
I am currently eperimenting with different features of OpenGL and I wanted to use Cmake for the first time in a proper project so that this can be build on multiple differnt platforms

# Building
To build the project you will need to have CMake installed on your machine \
Then you can run the following command \
`cmake -S . -B ./build` \
\
You can then build your solution on windows or the make files on Linux or whatever build system you are targeted on Cmake.
